Nice to have:
- rewrite io classes (if necessary) to use boost::filesystem to be platform independent
- Change GTXLReader and GTXLWriter documentation to be abstracted from the XML format and
  add XML dependent documentation to GTXLReaderXerces and GTXLWriterXerces

Special notices:
- the Isomorphism class must be revised bevor using it again

Suggested Optimizations:
- Prepare UQRules as a whole before starting analysis to minimize preparation while running.
- Delete UQRules if all instantiations are order morphisms.

Optional Optimizations:
- Replace hard coded, manual validation of GXL and GTXL with automated validation of Xerces.
- GTXLReaderXerces: replace key of nodeIDList with XMLCh* to circumvent transcoding to string
